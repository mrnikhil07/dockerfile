STACK:
Docker stack is used to create multiple services on multiple hosts. i.e it will create multiple containers on multile servers with the help of compose file.
To use the docker stack we have initialized docker swarm, if we are not using docker swarm, docker stack will not work.
once we remove the stack automatically all the containers will gets deleted.
We can share the containers from manager to worker according to the replicas
Ex: Lets assume if we have 2 servers which is manager and worker, if we deployed a stack with 4 replicas. 2 are present in manager and 2 are present in worker.
Here manager will divide the work based on the load on a server

COMMAND:
TO DEPLOY : docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml stack_name
TO LIST : docker stack ls
TO GET CONTAINERS OF A STACK : docker stack ps stack_name
TO GET SERVICES OF A STACK: docker stack services stack_name
TO DELETE A STACK: docker stack rm stack_name

PORTAINER:
it is a container organizer, designed to make tasks easier, whether they are clustered or not. 
abel to connect multiple clusters, access the containers, migrate stacks between clusters
it is not a testing environment mainly used for production routines in large companies.
Portainer consists of two elements, the Portainer Server and the Portainer Agent. 
Both elements run as lightweight Docker containers on a Docker engine

PRATCICAL:
Must have swarm mode and all ports enable with docker engine
curl -L https://downloads.portainer.io/ce2-16/portainer-agent-stack.yml -o portainer-agent-stack.yml
docker stack deploy -c portainer-agent-stack.yml portainer
 docker ps
